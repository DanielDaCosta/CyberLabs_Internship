RESULTS ANALYSIS


- Neural Network

The model has an accuracy an average accuracy of 84,366% on the test set and 87,55% on the train set. It's a reasonable result but not the best one. The model showed itself to be difficult to optimize since the neural network was small and so was the dataset.

- Support Vector Machines

The model has an average accuracy of 84,36%. The same result obtained with the Neural Network model, but with more consistent results.

30% of the data used to test the model.
