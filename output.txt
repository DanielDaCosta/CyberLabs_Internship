RESULTS ANALYSIS

The model has an accuracy an average accuracy 84,019% on the test set and 87,455% on the train set. It's a reasonable result but not the best one. The model showed itself to be difficult to optimize since the neural network was small and so was the dataset.

Train on 180 samples, validate on 20 samples.
